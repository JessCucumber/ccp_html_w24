            <p>Welcome to Jess is a Mess, my friends say I should start a podcast with my random thoughts and stories. I have a random obsession with traffic cones. My website will show you more random useless things, such as places I will never travel to, recipes I don't really do, and pets I have met and will miss in my life because UofM drains me entirely from taking care of animals  </p>

            <p>If you're  looking for a full time job, my work will soon be hiring a web developer and event coordinator. Currently, I am convincing my office to hire a data analyst in the fall</p>

        <div>
            <p>I love my job, and I mean it. It's a hybrid office, and you get a ton of experience. Many people are recent graduates that stay for a year or 2 and then leave for top companies (becuase you get the BEST experience).</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 29px; margin-right: 29px;">Founded in 1962 at the University of Michigan (U-M), the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) was the first teaching center in the country. CRLT is part of the Provost's Office and works with faculty, graduate student instructors (GSIs), and academic administrators in all nineteen schools and colleges to support and enhance learning and teaching at U-M. CRLT offers a comprehensive array of curricular and instructional development activities. CRLT's professional staff, with expertise in a range academic and administrative specialties, provide both cross-disciplinary, campus-wide programs and discipline-specific programs customized to the individual needs of departments, schools, and colleges. As an organization dedicated to promoting equity-focused teaching, we advance a University culture that values and rewards teaching, respects and supports individual differences among learners, and encourages the creation of learning environments in which diverse students and instructors can learn and excel.</p>
